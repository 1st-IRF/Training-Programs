Using ACE 3 to render medical care
==================================

Medics are expected to fully understand the ACE medical system including all possible symptoms and side effects as well as being drilled in quickly providing the correct care to patients.

In order to facilitate this goal you should carefully read through the following details of the ACE medical system. This is somewhat unique to our group based on the settings we use so you should read this with even greater care if you believe you already understand the medical system.

You should also be advised that not all avenues of treatment are available to all personnel and as such the system may be more complicated than the "hit them with a PAK" method used in other groups.

The Basics
-----------

In ACE the human body is represented as 6 distinct areas that can receive damage. Some of these areas have special abilities such as applying a tourniquet or using a variety of IV solutions.

Each living person in the battlespace has three key metrics which define their state of health. Every action you take will be to maintain or restore one of these metrics:

  * Blood Volume
  * Pulse
  * Responsive State ( Are they concious? )

**Blood Volume**

Blood volume is measured via blood pressure is measured by systolic and diastolic blood pressure - often expressed in the form ( systolic / diastolic ).

In ARMA you only need to pay attention to the systolic blood pressure to diagnose a condition. You can categorize blood pressure into colour categories as follows:

  * **BLACK** - No Pressure - 0-20 systolic
  * **RED** - Low Pressure - 20-100 systolic
  * **GREEN** - Normal Pressure - 100-160 systolic
  * **YELLOW** - High Pressure - 160 and above systolic

In the treatment section you will find out how to deal with these blood pressures.

**Pulse**

The Pulse - an indication of Heart Rate or Arterial Palpation - is the number of beats per minute that the patient's heart makes.

In ARMA we classify these into categories:

  * **BLACK** - No Pulse - 0 BPM
  * **RED** - Low Pulse - 45 BPM
  * **GREEN** - Normal Pulse - 46-119 BPM
  * **YELLOW** - High Pulse - 120 and above BPM

Blood pressure is affected by the patient's blood volume and administered medication.

**Responsive State**

If a patient's pulse or blood volume falls to low the patient will become unconcious ( non-responsive ). Responsiveness comes in two forms:

  * **BLACK** - Un Responsive
  * **GREEN** - Responsive

MEDSTAT
-------

A MEDSTAT is essentially an ACE report for patients. It consists of Blood Volume then Pulse then Responsive State.

For example:

  RED - GREEN - BLACK is a non responsive casualty with a normal pulse and a low blood pressure.

MEDSTATs allow for rapid communication about the status of a casualty.
