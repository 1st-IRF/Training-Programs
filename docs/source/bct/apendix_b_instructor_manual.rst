.. _instructor_outline:

Instructor Outline
-------------------

**Runtime:** Approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes

**Class Size:** Between 2 and 8 people at any one time

**Instructors Required:** One Instructor for every four people

.. _introduction:

Introduction
---------------

The primary purpose of BCT is to provide recruits with an introduction to the unit and a base level of knowledge. Harsh discipline found in later trainings should be applied more loosley here - however the same level of professionalism should be demanded.

Practically speaking this means that in BCT you should not degrade the recruits but correct any errors they may encounter during the training. If a recruit repeatedly makes the same mistake then feel free to call him out on that but do not resort to hazing - this is BCT not SOFS.

This training is an indoctrination and a test. You should asses each recruit on the basis of are they good guys and are they going to work in a MILSIM environment?

Don't directly take action based on these feelings but do include it in the Training Report you file at the end of the training.

.. warning::

  If at any point a recruit reveals they have not read the documentation fully they should be removed from the session and told to apply for the next available time slot.

.. _forming_up:

Stage 1 - Forming Up
------------------------------------------------

Basic Training will start punctually within five minutes of the scheduled time. Any recruit arriving more than five minutes later than the marked time should be politely turned away citing that it is clearly stated that this event requires punctuality.

Make special exception in the case that the recruit contacts you in advance allowing a delay of up to 20 minutes. He should be bought up to speed BEFORE the training begins on the content covered in Stage 2.

.. note::

  Instructors should allow for ambient conversation whilst waiting for other recruits to reduce animosity and should instead at least allow conversation. Ideally the instructor should initiate a Q and A style format with the recruits to help them learn more about the unit.

.. _loadout:

Stage 2 - Ensuring Correct Setup and Loadout Walkthrough
---------------------------------------------------------

At this time the instructor should check that recruits have downloaded the modpack and have the latest version of ARMA III. Any recruit that fails to meet these criteria should be immediately dropped from the class. You should not allow time to download the mods or delay the training for that individual.

Once this is complete you should get your recruits loaded into the game and load them into a flat bed truck to move around the island.

Your first stop should be the arsenal where you explain how to use it by making recruits form a line in front of you and demonstrating.

.. note::

  ACE is extremely confusing for new players - be prepared to spend at least 30 minutes on this stage getting people comfortable with the ACE controls and loaded into the loadout provided.

Once all recruits have their web loadout perform an inspection of the recruits by calling them to attention. Be firm but not insulting if a recruit fails to adequately order themselves into a line.

.. _familiarization:

Stage 3 - Weapon Familiarization Test
--------------------------------------

Ask recruits at a random pick what the standard weapons of the RRF are for a given position:

Eight questions are provided below to be asked of candidates; failure to answer correctly is not reason for dismissal but if there is indication they have not read the literature then that should result in removal from the session.

**Questions:**

*Candidates should be asked one question each.*

1. What is the standard issue assualt rifle of the 1st RRF

2. What is the standard issue DMR or Marksman Rifle of the 1st RRF

3. What is the name of a rocket launcher used by the 1st RRF

4. What caliber is our standard issue assualt rifle chambered for

5. What is our standard issue pistol

6. What are the two extra pistol options a 1st RRF member may select from

7. What is the Barret M87 used for in the 1st RRF

8. What is the standard issue light machine gun of the 1st RRF

**Weapon Safety Test***

Candidates should be made to as a group repeat the three rules of weapon safety.

**Ammunition Cage**

Candidates should be shown the Ammunition Cage on base for future reference but it should be explained that Ammo will be provided at the ranges themselves.

This step will likely take around 5 to 10 minutes.

.. _qualification:

Stage 4 - Weapon Qualification
-------------------------------

At this time you should load your recruits into the flatbed truck and proceed to the firing ranges.

Clearly explain that safety violations or attempting to cheat will cause them to fail the training program.

Run candidates through the ranges. If you have multiple candidates and multiple instructors you may choose to run different ranges simultaneously to accelerate the process.

All candidates must shoot each range twice and scores are automatically reported. Do not worry about recording scores - focus on the recruits to ensure they are not breaking the rules and do not have issues with the range scripts.

This step will likely take around 40 minutes with a full group.

.. _buddy_tactics:

Stage 5 - Buddy Team Tactics
------------------------------

Recruits should be moved to the Automatic Weapon and Grenade Launcher range for this phase.

Split recruits into teams of two - taking care to help foster any bond between two recruits that is forming.

Recruits should be shown a demonstration of both singing guns and the buddy bound and then asked to perform it.

There shouldn't be any reason to fail recruits at this stage unless they commit a gross safety violation or suffer a general attitude failure.

.. _finish:

Stage 6 - Finish
------------------------------

Bring the recruits to attention and welcome them to the 1st RRF.

Guide the recruits to go and register for AIT 1 classes in their chosen speciality.

Recommend that they check the "Your first week in the RRF" section for a guide on how to get started.

Let them know that new content was unlocked in the arsenal and they should check that out.

Salute them and release them from training.

.. note::

  Please file a Training Report immediately after training is completed so recruits are credited with their session and able to apply to AIT's as quickly as possible.
