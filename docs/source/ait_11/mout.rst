MOUT - Military Operations in Urban Terrain
===================================================

As an infantryman in the RRF you will be expected to be able to perform operations in urban environnments including breaching and clearing structures as well as moving through an urban area safely.

The Fatal Funnel
----------------

.. note::
  The fatal funnel is the area of a breach point that presents the most danger to an entry.  The team must clear this area as quickly as possible to prevent disruption of the breach.  Threats inside the breach will focus fire on this point once entry is made.

.. danger::
  Windows also present danger to a breaching element.  Team members must use caution when approaching or stacking near windows and security should be maintained on windows when possible.

Approaching a Structure
-----------------------

A Team should approach a building in a modified file formation which is adjusted for security and speed of movement. The formation will be modified dynamically by the Team Leader to provide the maximum security during movement to the Breach.

Take special care when the building you are approaching has windows. You should remain below the sight level of the window and keep strong security on the appeture so as to decrease detection probability and minimize the risk of hostiles inside firing out at the element.

Performing a Breach
--------------------

**Setting a Stack**

The first step to breaching is to stack on the door. The first man in the stack will maintain security on the breach while the second, third and fourth men will adjust their sectors of fire to provide maximum security around the element including but not limited to the rear and high side threats.

**Breacher Up**

If a ballistic, explosive or flashbang breach are required the team leader will call "Breacher Up" at which time the number 2 man will maneouver to a wide angle position ahead of the stack from which he is able to effectively deploy the required breaching tools.

.. note::
  Not every breach point will require a Breacher.

**Status Check**

The team leader will do a status check in reverse order by calling out "Status". Each team member in the stack should respond in descending order:

"4 up", "3 up", "2 up", "1 up"

If any team member fails to call ready or says they are "down" then the formation will hold until the issue has been resolved.

**Clearing the Funnel**

The team leader will call breach at which time the team should move to clear the fatal funnel as quickly as possible and begin movement to the points of domination.

Team members should alternate the direction of travel starting from the first man in. There is not a need to coordinate this information before the breach and it should be reactive.

.. warning::
  A common mistake for new soldiers is to think that the breaching team should move through the center of the room. In general you should remain close to the walls during your movement to a point of domination so that you are not exposed to unnecessary angles.
