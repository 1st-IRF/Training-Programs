Introduction to Battle Drills
==============================

Battle Drills are practiced responses to a given situation that represent the ideal mechanism for the response.

They define our normal response to situations in ideal conditions however, your squad leader will have received training on their use and implementation. As such they tend to fall more as guidelines that are adapted to the situation in the field. You should be prepared for this by having the best possible knowledge of these drills so that you are able to understand how to modify and implement them.

.. note::

  Many Battle Drills are not taught directly at the AIT level. You Squad Leader will train you in more Battle Drills depending on your element's role and his insight into your squad.

React to Contact Drill
-----------------------

This drill is designed to be employed when the team is transitioning ( moving positions as opposed to emplaced in cover and concealment ).

The setting of this battle drill is that a squad is moving as two distinct fire teams, with the squad leader in the rear half or centre of the element.

The first team in the movement receive contact. This team immediately seeks a covered and concealed position to engage the contact with suppressing fire. At this time, the lead team is designated as being decisively engaged; That is to say that they cannot retreat without receiving effective fires from the enemy position.

At this time the second fire team will find a concealed position and avoid decisive engagement.

The squad leader will then manoeuvre via cover or concealment up to the engaged team. He will asses the situation and make an assessment of the correct response at that time.

He will decide between conducting a flanking manoeuvre, breaking contact, or setting up a support by fire position for a platoon level action. The scope of this decision making process is outlined in the Squad Leader training program and is not relevant to this drill.

At this point all of these responses form a part of another battle drill.

Break Contact Rear
--------------------

This drill assumes that the squad is on line, being engaged from the 12 o clock.

The squad leader gives the order for the squad to conduct a break contact rear and selects a team to move first.

At this time the fire team leader of the selected team will order his team to deploy smoke grenades to create a smoke screen between their position and that of the enemy. Care should be taken to check the wind direction so as not to cover the overwatch team's view.

Once the smoke has propagated, the fire team will direct his team to retreat backwards to a covered position if possible, but no further than 1 minutes sprint. From this position the team will emplacement and signal to the squad leader that the second fire team should now retreat.

The second fire team will follow the same practices of deploying smoke and moving backwards.

This drill is a successive bounding manoeuvre, meaning that the teams should end on line with each other and should not retreat past the other team.

Assualt on the Flank
---------------------

The flank assault is a technique for assaulting an element where a strategic location is defended by a force that is unable to gain superiority of fires over the squad.

This technique works by the first fire team providing suppressive fire onto the objective whilst the second fire team moves via a concealed route to the flank of the enemy position.

Once the team is set on the enemies flank, the team leader will signal to the squad leader that the team is prepared to assault.

At this time, the squad leader will give the order for the overwatch team to lift or shift fire. This involves moving the field of fire away from the direction of the friendly forces.

Once the overwatch team has shifted their fires, the assaulting element will form on line and push through the objective, coming to a halt on the far edge of the objective to the side on which they assaulted from.

Once the assault team has reached this point, officially called the limit of advance, the overwatch fire team will assault through the objective, complete any actives on the objective such as destroying emplaned equipment and finally ending their advance at the outer edge of the objective on line.

Setting up for a platoon action
--------------------------------

At a Platoon level the same battle drills are used except entire squads are used instead of fireteams.

In this effect a platoon react to contact drill might work like this:

1. The first squad takes contact, becomes decisevly engaged and communicated the contact information whilst suppresing the target

2. Second squad move to flank and push through the contact

3. Second squad assault and move to the line of advance on the objective.

4. First squad move up and push to the line of advance on the objective.
