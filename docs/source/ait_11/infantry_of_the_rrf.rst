The Infantry of the 1st RRF
=====================================

The infantry is the most important part of the 1st RRF. They fight the battles on the ground and are the primary force used to accomplish command objectives.

The RRF aims to maintain a standing force of 120 infantry personnel, roughly the size of a company in real life.

This training program represents one of the most comprehensive infantry training programs available in any ARMA III unit, which in turn leads us to having some of the highest quality infantry personnel found in the ARMA community. We take great pride in our infantry and by taking AIT 11 series you are taking the first step toward upholding that standard.

Life in the Infantry
------------------------

We deploy Infantry elements by the squad to AORs based on their size, ability and training status relative to what is required in the battlespace.

Infantry elements are called Squads which fall into Platoons - this will be explained in more detail in the next chapter.

As a member of the infantry you will be deployed to one of our active AORs for rought three weeks at a time in line with our deployment process covered in the BCT course.

Prior to deployment, your element will undergo a TDY program where your squad leader will recap the parts of your training which will be used in the specific environment to make sure eveyone is functioning at their best.

The 1st RRF tries not to add new members into formations that are on active deployment, however we will occasionally do so to compensate operational reductions or attrition.

Once deployed, you will be tasked with between one and three operations a week in the AOR depending on the situation on the ground and the availability of your element.

Progressing in the Infantry
------------------------------

Once you complete this AIT program and take the AIT II class for your selected position you might want to know how you can further advance your career in the 1st RRF.

Your immediate thoughts should be on doing a great job in the position you are assigned and showing that you can work well in a team as well as showing leadership at appropriate times.

Once you complete you first deployment with your element you will likely be eligible for promotion to Specialist.

Upon achieving the rank of Specialist you will be able to apply to some new courses. You may also choose to remain in your infantry position indefinitely if you are content with your current position.

Some examples of the courses that will become available to you are:

**Joint Service Radio School**

  The JSRS is a comprehensive school for radio operation and procedure in the 1st RRF. It is an extremely important course if you wish to progress to any position of leadership or command as you will make regular use of your skills to communicate on the battlefield.

  Taking JSRS means that you are able to become a Fire Team Leader, giving you an opportunity to command a small group of personnel and start a career in leadership.

**Tactical Combat Casualt Care Training**

  TC3 is our school for medical and trauma care. The primary focus is on training you to handle casualties on the battlefield including conducting triage and rendering aid to wounded personnel - both friendly and hostile - in line with the internation rules of war.

  Taking the TC3 program will also train you how to serve as a flight medic and rear line medical aid provider should you wish to apply to one of these positions. Finally qualifying on TC3 will allow you to apply for an MOS transfer to 68W Combat Medic and take up medical positions in the infantry platoons.

**Demolition and EOD Training Program**

  The Demolitions and EOD program is designed to train members of the unit on how to plant, activate, detonate and defuse explosive ordance safely on the battlefield.

  This course will qualify you to carry and utilise explosives and demolition equipment.

**Special Operations Forces Selection Program**

  Although it is exceptionally rare for someone to be accepted to the SOFS program before reaching at least SGT or more usually SSG, extremely promising candidates or those with existing experience in hardcore MILSIM environments may choose to apply for SOFS.

  This course will test your commitment to our level of simulation as well as training you in advanced tactics and weapon handling drills.

  SOFS takes approximately two and a half months of regular game time to complete and can only be attempted twice.
