Tactical Casualty Care
======================

All infantry units are trained in basic combat casualty care necessary to heal troops with small wounds or move casualties on to further medical care.

RRF environments use a full medical pipeline and casualties will require MEDEVAC or CASEVAC to be healed at Level 3 medical facilities if they sustain grevious wounds.

Standard Medical Equipment
--------------------------

A standard infantry first aid kit cotains the following equipment:

  * 2x Combat Application Tourniquet
  * 4x Field Bandages
  * 2x Packing Bandages
  * 2x Elastic Bandages
  * 4x Quik Clot
  * 2x Morphine
  * 1x Saline 500 ml

Using the ACE Medical System
-----------------------------

In game we use the ACE 3 medical system to provide a medical simulator.

To interact with another player and render medical aid to them you should hold down your ACE interact key ( The windows key by default ) then select the Interactions > Medical Menu button.

This will display the ACE 3 medical menu where you can view the status of each body part and any wounds that have been received to that body part.

To apply treatment to a body part you should left click on it in the diagram and use the icons in the top left to select a sub menu. In that submenu you will have a list of available treatments - this list is determined by the equipment you are carrying and level of medical training you have.

Care under Fire
-----------------------------------------------

.. danger::
  You should not attempt to render aid to a casualty until the friendly force has obtained fire superiority.

  Failure to ensure that the friendly force hold fire superiority can lead to a multiplication of casualties as first responders become injured.

In the event that a friendly unit has been wounded in an engagement and superiority of fire has been obtained you should evaluate the status of the casualty:

  **Concious and Ambulatory Patient**

  If the patient is concious and able to move they will suppress the enemy as they move to a covered position where it is safe for aid to be rendered.

  **Unconcious or Non Ambulatory Patient**

  If the patient is Unconcious or Non Ambulatory then you should arrange for one of your team to cover you whilst you move the casualty to a covered area so that aid can be rendered.

  **Dead Patient**

  If a patient is showing NO signs of life including No Pulse, No Breathing, No Blood Pressure and is shown as dead you should not render further medical aid. This patient is now classed as a Black Casualty status and should not be prioritized over any other casualties.

  If no other casualties are found the body should be covered and transported to the nearest CCP or CASEVAC.

Once the casualty is in a secure location you should administer life saving hemorrhage control to stem any active bleeds the casualty may be experiencing.

You should first use tourniquets immediately on any extremeties that are suffering from a bleed. Prioritise extremeties with the largest bleeds to minimize the blood loss as much as possible.

Once tourniquets have been applied to the casualty you should then bandage any wounds you can see to minimize blood loss.

.. note ::
  In the event that the casualty does not have a pulse you should have a teammate perform CPR until the casualty is declared dead or handed over to a superior level of medical care.

As soon as possible the casualty should be transferred to the nearest CCP for evaluation, treatment and if needed extraction to a medical facility.

Transferring a Casualty to a CCP
---------------------------------

When operating in a platoon sized element you will normally be operating with an attached medic. You should be aware of the Casualty Collection Point for the formation which will be a manned position operated by the Platoon Medic where casualties can be triaged and processed for follow on medical care.

If the casualty is ambulatory you should escort them to the CCP. In the event that the casualty is non ambulatory you should carry or drag them to the CCP depending on the distance.

.. note::

  The 1st RRF does not issue pill packs to personnel. There is no need to administer antibiotics to members.

When handing over a casualty to the CCP you should be sure to inform them of the casualty's name, element, status and any medication that may have been adminsitered such as morphine or epinephrine.

The CCP will then triage the casualty and may ask you to remain at the CCP in order to administed CPR to the patient until MEDEVAC has arrived.

Notifying Element Leader of a Casualty Event
---------------------------------------------

**Wounded In Action**

"7 this is 1, times two Whiskeys - 1 Red, 1 Yellow"

In this you should relay that you have a given number of Whiskeys (wounded) and the statuses of each whiskey.

**Killed In Action**

"7 this is 1, times one Kilo - Casualty Name"
