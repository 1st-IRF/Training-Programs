Combat Medicine
===============

All infantry units are trained in basic combat casualty care necessary to heal troops with small wounds or move casualties on to further medical care.

RRF environments use a full medical pipeline and casualties will require MEDEVAC or CASEVAC to be healed at Level 3 medical facilities if they sustain grevious wounds.
