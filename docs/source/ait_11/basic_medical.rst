Combat Medicine
===============

All infantry units are trained in basic combat casualty care necessary to heal troops with small wounds or move casualties on to further medical care.

RRF environments use a full medical pipeline and casualties will require MEDEVAC or CASEVAC to be healed at Level 3 medical facilities if they sustain grevious wounds.

Standard Medical Equipment
--------------------------

A standard infantry first aid kit cotains the following equipment:

  * 5x Field Bandages
  * 2x Quik Clot
  * 2x Morphine Autoinjectors
  * 2x Elastic Bandages
  * 2x Tourniquet
  * 1x Saline IV (500ml) - Carried for use by medic
  * 1x Bodybag

Using the ACE Medical System
-----------------------------

In game we use the ACE 3 medical system to provide a medical simulator.

To interact with another player and render medical aid to them you should hold down your ACE interact key ( The windows key by default ) then select the Interactions > Medical Menu button.

This will display the ACE 3 medical menu where you can view the status of each body part and any wounds that have been received to that body part.

To apply treatment to a body part you should left click on it in the diagram and use the icons in the top left to select a sub menu. In that submenu you will have a list of available treatments - this list is determined by the equipment you are carrying and level of medical training you have.

Care under Fire
-----------------------------------------------

.. danger::
  You should not attempt to render aid to a casualty until the friendly force has obtained fire superiority.

  Failure to ensure that the friendly force hold fire superiority can lead to a multiplication of casualties as first responders become injured.

In the event that a friendly unit has been wounded in an engagement and superiority of fire has been obtained you should evaluate the status of the casualty:

  **Concious and Ambulatory Patient**

  If the patient is concious and able to move they will suppress the enemy as they move to a covered position where it is safe for aid to be rendered.

  **Unconcious or Non Ambulatory Patient**

  If the patient is Unconcious or Non Ambulatory then you should arrange for one of your team to cover you whilst you move the casualty to a covered area so that aid can be rendered.

  **Dead Patient**

  If a patient is showing NO signs of life including No Pulse, No Breathing and No Blood Pressure you should not render further medical aid. This patient is now classed as a Black Casualty status and should not be prioritized over any other casualties.

  If no other casualties are found the body should be covered and transported to the nearest CCP or CASEVAC.
